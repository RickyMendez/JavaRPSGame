Rock Paper Scissors game built with Java and the swing library

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game that was my favorite assignment in my OOP class in college.
It's my favorite because I used a picture of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson instead of an ordinary rock.
Why be ordinary when you can be extrodinary like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson!
